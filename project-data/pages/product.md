## What Users See
A detailed product page showing a large product image on the left, product metadata (name, rating, description, price) in the center, and a purchase card on the right with pricing summary and "Add To Cart" button.

Below the purchase section, a reviews area displays existing customer reviews and provides an authenticated user with a form to submit a new review (rating 1-5 and comment). Non-authenticated users see a message prompting them to sign in to write a review.
